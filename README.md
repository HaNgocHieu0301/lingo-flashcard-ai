# LingoFlip AI: AI-Powered Flashcards

LingoFlip AI is an interactive web application designed to help users learn English vocabulary effectively. Leveraging the power of Google's Gemini AI, users can generate custom flashcard decks on any topic and test their knowledge with AI-generated multiple-choice questions.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Deck Generation:**
    *   Enter any topic (e.g., "Travel Vocabulary," "Business Idioms," "Common Phrasal Verbs").
    *   Specify the desired number of flashcards (1-20).
    *   The Gemini AI generates relevant words, clear definitions, and contextual example sentences for each card.
*   **Interactive Flashcard Study:**
    *   View flashcards one by one.
    *   Click to flip cards and reveal definitions and examples.
    *   Navigate through the deck with "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
    *   Shuffle the current deck for varied learning.
    *   Option to clear the current deck and start a new one.
*   **AI-Generated Tests:**
    *   Initiate a test based on the currently generated flashcard deck.
    *   For each flashcard, the AI creates a multiple-choice question (MCQ).
    *   MCQs are fill-in-the-blank style, using the example sentence from the flashcard with the target word blanked out.
    *   Each question provides four options: the correct word and three plausible distractors, also generated by AI.
    *   Receive immediate feedback on your answer.
    *   View an AI-generated explanation for why the correct answer is appropriate in the context.
*   **Test Summary & Retry:**
    *   After completing the test, view a summary of your score.
    *   Option to retry the test with the same set of questions (shuffled).
*   **User-Friendly Interface:**
    *   Clean, responsive design built with Tailwind CSS.
    *   Loading indicators for AI generation processes.
    *   Clear error messages and guidance.
    *   Sample deck provided for new users or when the API key is not configured.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:**
    *   React (v19+) with Hooks
    *   TypeScript
*   **AI Integration:**
    *   Google Gemini API (`@google/genai` library)
    *   Model: `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`
*   **Styling:**
    *   Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
*   **Module Management:**
    *   ES Modules imported directly via `esm.sh` in `index.html`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is designed to run directly in a modern web browser that supports ES modules.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
*   An active internet connection (for loading dependencies and interacting with the Gemini API).

### API Key Setup

LingoFlip AI requires a Google Gemini API key to generate flashcards and test questions.

1.  Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  The application expects the API key to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`. How you set this up depends on your hosting or development environment:
    *   **For local development in some setups (e.g., using a local server that injects environment variables):** You might set it in a `.env` file (ensure this file is not committed to version control if it's public). The application code (`services/geminiService.ts`) directly tries to access `process.env.API_KEY`.
    *   **For simple local testing without a build process:** You can temporarily set it in your browser's developer console before the application loads (not recommended for regular use):
        ```javascript
        // In browser console, before scripts in index.html run, or modify index.html to include:
        // <script> process = { env: { API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" } }; </script>
        // This is a workaround for the direct `process.env.API_KEY` access in a simple browser environment.
        ```
    *   **When deploying:** Configure the `API_KEY` as an environment variable in your hosting platform's settings.

**Note:** If the API key is not detected, the application will fall back to using a pre-defined sample deck and dummy data for test generation, with features related to new AI content generation disabled.

### Running the Application

1.  Ensure all project files (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `types.ts`, and files in `components/` and `services/`) are in the same directory structure.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Generate Flashcards:**
    *   The app loads with a sample deck. To create your own:
    *   Enter a topic you want to learn about in the "Topic" field.
    *   Select the number of cards you want (1-20).
    *   Click "Generate Cards." Wait for the AI to create your custom deck.
2.  **Study Flashcards:**
    *   The first card of your generated deck will be displayed.
    *   Click the card to flip it and see the definition and example sentence.
    *   Use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through your deck.
    *   Click "Shuffle" to randomize the order of cards in the current deck.
3.  **Take a Test:**
    *   Once a deck is generated (and it's not the initial sample deck), a "Start Test" button will appear below the flashcard.
    *   Click "Start Test." The AI will generate multiple-choice questions for each card in your deck.
    *   For each question, read the sentence and select the word you believe best fills the blank.
    *   You'll receive immediate feedback. The correct answer and an explanation will be shown.
    *   Click "Next Question" to proceed.
4.  **Review Your Score:**
    *   After the last question, a summary screen will show your score.
    *   You can choose to "Retry Test" or go "Back to Flashcards."
5.  **Start a New Deck:**
    *   Click "Start New Deck" (available when you have a generated deck) to clear the current cards and input form, allowing you to create a new set.
